Security Risks
# Host 172.20.46.126
- Port 53/tcp (DNS):
  - Risks: Vulnerable to DNS amplification attacks, spoofing, or unauthorized access if misconfigured.
  - Mitigation: Enable DNSSEC, restrict recursive queries.

# Host 172.20.46.155
- Port 135/tcp (msrpc):
  - Risks: Exploitable for remote code execution if unpatched (e.g., MS03-026).
  - Mitigation: Apply Windows patches, restrict access.
- Port 139/tcp (netbios-ssn):
  - Risks: Unauthorized file access, man-in-the-middle attacks, worm propagation.
  - Mitigation: Disable if unused, use SMBv2+, segment network.
- Port 445/tcp (microsoft-ds):
  - Risks: SMB exploits (e.g., WannaCry), credential theft, ransomware.
  - Mitigation: Patch systems, disable SMBv1, restrict access.
- Port 8990/tcp (opsmessaging):
  - Risks: Unknown vulnerabilities, potential backdoor, data leakage.
  - Mitigation: Identify software, update, restrict access.

# General Risks
- Limited host detection may hide compromised devices.
- Open ports on a local network increase lateral movement risk.
- Legacy services (e.g., NetBIOS) suggest outdated systems prone to exploits.
